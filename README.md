Technical Challenges:
 Spring Boot was new topic to me, and it was hard in beginning couple of days, but I overcome it by collaborating more with classmates, instructors and taking advantages of different resources such as YouTube, stack overflow, google etc. I also had some difficulties in Unit testing, but Mockito helped me a lot. It was also challenging to link CSS file and Images to JSP. It was very different than to link CSS and Images to Html.
